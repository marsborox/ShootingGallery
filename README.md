Unity version 2022.3.33f1
Shooting gallery game inspired by Moorhuhn

itch.io https://marsboro.itch.io/shootinggallery
game is in beta

i tried to use / learn design patterns : 
singleton(audio - classes Singleton and  ), Flywheel, Strategy, Object pool
FlyWheel - targets spawned take data from SO (mabye not properly implemented)
Object pool - each weapon has its own for projectiles, targets are pooled,
i wasnt able to make particles spawn from pool for some reason
